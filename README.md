## Transliteration

Transliterations to/from Indian languages are still generally low quality. One problem is access to data. Another is that there is no standard  transliteration.

For Hindi--English, we build novel dataset for names using the ESPNcricinfo. For instance, see [here](https://www.espncricinfo.com/hindi/series/pakistan-tour-of-england-2021-1239529/england-vs-pakistan-1st-odi-1239537/full-scorecard) for Hindi version of the [English scorecard](https://www.espncricinfo.com/series/pakistan-tour-of-england-2021-1239529/england-vs-pakistan-1st-odi-1239537/full-scorecard). 

We also create a dataset from [election affidavits](https://affidavit.eci.gov.in/CandidateCustomFilter)

We also exploit the [Google Dakshina dataset](https://github.com/google-research-datasets/dakshina).

To overcome the fact that there isn't one standard way of transliteration, we provide k-best transliterations.
