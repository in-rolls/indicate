# Xlit-IITB-Par

This is a corpus containing transliteration pairs for Hindi-English. These pairs were automatically mined from the IIT Bombay English-Hindi Parallel Corpus using the Moses Transliteration Module. The corpus contains 68,922 pairs.

The distribution contains two files: 

- en-hi.mined-pairs: The mined pairs using default Transliteration Module settings
- en-hi.pair-probs: All possible pairs along with a score for each pair. By changing the threshold for selecting pairs, you can obtain a custom-mined corpus. The  file `en-hi.mined-pairs` contains the pairs mined using the default Transliteration Module threshold.
